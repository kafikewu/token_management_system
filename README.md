# Token Managment System
Every organization has processes that require the involvement of various personnel from the organizationâ€™s hierarchy. Such processes may take weeks or months to process and the personnel associated with the process usually does not have any convenient system to keep track of the process. As a result, they often have to submit to the solicitation; which is inconvenient for all the parties involved. Our team introduces a web application that assigns a token to each process and makes it convenient for the users to track the progression of a process. Keeping adaptability, security, and robustness in mind, we have devised a Token management system for East West University. Furthermore, with its easy-to-use interface, it can be tweaked to be used in any organization to manage its complex procedures with the click of a few buttons.\
